                        <h3>Why do I have to pre-pay?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We sell loaves by walk-up and pre-order.
                            Since we typically sell out, we often have to turn away walk-up customers.
                            If people don't pre-pay, then we lose money every time someone forgets to pick up their bread,
                            because we turned away a walk-up customer who would have paid for it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What if I forgot to pick up my bread?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This actually happens a lot. We're sorry, but if you haven't picked up your bread by 7 pm (or made other arrangements),
                            then your bread will be given away. We can't offer a refund or future credit, because we would lose too much money.

                    <div class="mt-5" id="expensive">
                        <h3>Why is your bread so expensive!?!?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm glad you asked! There are a few reasons:<br><br>
                            1) We only use organic, artisinal flour, which is <strong>not</strong> cheap!<br>
                            2) Making bread takes time! We hand mix, scale, shape, and bake all of our loaves in a wood fired oven. The whole process takes around 6-10 person-hours, and spans two days!<br>
                            <br>
                            It really boils down to this: We love baking, but we need to be able to make at least minimum wage to justify selling bread.
